Wave Simulation with ImGui Control

Overview
This project showcases a real-time wave simulation using OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW, with a customizable interface provided by ImGui. The simulation utilizes Perlin Noise to generate realistic wave patterns that can be dynamically adjusted through various parameters.

Features
Real-time Wave Simulation: Experience a dynamic wave simulation that responds in real time to parameter adjustments.
ImGui Integration: Easily modify wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, speed, deformation, phase offset, and intensity using intuitive sliders.
Preset Management: Save and load presets for your wave settings using a convenient file dialog interface.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Run the simulation on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
